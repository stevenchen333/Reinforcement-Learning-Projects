The algorithm for expected return:
1. the immediate cost is based on the action at the start of the ay a_t * cost
2. calculate casrs at the start of the day at each locations
3. 
    - For each possible of realization of renting amount:
        - calculate the probability of renting x given lambda
        - calculate the amount that can be rented
        - calculate the rweard after renting
        - calculate how many cars are left
        - initialize expected value
        - for each realization of return amount:
            -calculate probability of return x given lambda
            - how many cars after return
            - calculate joint probability of return = x and renting = y
            - calculate expected value of next state
        - returns = probability of renting*(immediate reward + 0.9*expected value)
